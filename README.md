# Gama-Homework
In this GAMA and Agents festival simulation, we've designed an environment where festival guests can experience hunger or thirst and actively seek out stores to fulfill these needs. These guests acquire store locations by interacting with an information center. As the simulation evolves, we introduce memory for the guests to remember visited locations, adding an element of unpredictability. 

How to run:
Open GAMA 1.7 (or a newer version).
Create a new project and import the provided files from the zip archive.
